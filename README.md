# Tweet Emotion Classifier (LSTM + TensorFlow)

This project is a deep learning-based emotion classifier that analyzes tweets and predicts the emotional tone expressed. It uses an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network built with TensorFlow.
- Classifies tweets into multiple emotions -> 'sadness','joy','love','anger','fear','surprise'.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Numpy / Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib (for training visualization)

## 📁 Dataset
The dataset consists of labeled tweets with corresponding emotions. Each tweet is preprocessed (lowercased, cleaned, tokenized) before feeding into the model.
